# Infrasound Processing Toolbox: Overview

**Original Author:** Carrick L. Talmadge, Ph.D.

This manual describes a set of software packages written at the National Center
for Physical Acoustics (NCPA), authored primarily by Carrick
Talmadge ([clt@olemiss.edu](mailto:clt@olemiss.edu)).

The main objective of this release is to provide source code, scripts, and
documentation that are a combination of open-source and privileged within the
NACT community sources that serve a variety of needs.

## Objectives include:

* Providing GNU GPL open-source software package together with data
  suite for validation and verification of the US infrasound calibration
  methodology.
* Provide benchmark code for cross-validating software routines.

The tools provided incorporate functionality that isn't available in other
open-source packages or aren't packaged together to be immediately useful for
infrasound data processing.

The compiled code is written in C, which is meant to serve as a toolchain.
Meaning,
the programs provide functionality and accept many command-line arguments,
typically combined using scripts to create higher-level
functionality.
