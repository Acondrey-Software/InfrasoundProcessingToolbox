## Overview

DFFT, which stands for “Double-precision Fast Fourier Transform”, is a general
purpose command line tool developed by Carrick Talmadge. This software both
implements and generalizes the Welch periodogram (Welch 1967). [The Welch
periodogram](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/5688766 "PSD Computations
Using Welch’s Method") is a method for
computing the power spectral density (PSD) of a
signal. The PSD is a measure of the power of a signal as a function of
frequency.
